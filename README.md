I'm a Computer Science Engineering student on a mission to blend creativity with code. I'm passionate about building cool things, securing digital fortresses, and diving deep into the world of AI.

🚀 About Me
🎓 Studying: B.Tech in Computer Science at Govt. Model Engineering College (Class of 2026).

💻 Coding Spells: I cast spells in Python, Java, C, and the magical trio of HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

🛡️ Cyber-Knight: I've dabbled in the dark arts of cybersecurity, learning to defend realms from digital dragons during my internship at CDAC.

🎨 Creative Soul: When I'm not coding, you can find me sketching ideas in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop.

🗣️ Talkative Techie: I love a good debate, a public speaking challenge, and writing about things that excite me.

🛠️ My Tech Arsenal
Here are a few of the technologies I've been working with recently:

✨ My Quests (Projects)
Here are some of the adventures I've been on:

College Predictor: Wielded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a portal that helps students foresee their college admission chances.

Mouse-Movement CAPTCHA: A quest to defeat bots! I helped build a CAPTCHA that knows you're human by the way you move your mouse.

ARP Spoofing Detector: Forged a tool with Python and Scapy to stand guard against network tricksters.

🌱 I’m currently learning...
I'm always looking to level up my skills. Right now, I'm diving deeper into:

Machine Learning & Neural Networks

Advanced Cybersecurity Techniques

Data Science Adventures

📫 Let's Connect!
I'm always up for a chat about tech, a new project, or a good book recommendation!
